# Final_Project_Columbia

## Topic of Final Project
 Credit score classification
 
## Reasons for Selecting the Topic
As interest rate keeps on getting higher, the topic of credit will become pertinent in that current credit card holder will pay more interest, future credit applicant will face more hurdles to get approved. In order to better assess applicants and classify them in category that will help in the decision making process, we want to apply machine learning to the credit classification process. 

## Description of Source of Data
As interest rates keep on getting raised by the Federal Reserve Bank, the topic of credit is becoming pertinent in that current credit card holders will pay more in interest, future credit applicant will face more hurdles to get approved. In order to better assess applicants and classify them in category that will help in the decision making process. We want to apply machine learning to the credit classification process. 
## Questions to be answered 

## Segment 1 
### Tools used in Segment 1
Some of the tools that we used during Segment 1 are Jupyter Notebook, SQL/PgAdmin and Excel.

### Description of Process in Segment 1
During the development of segment 1, we used Jupyter Notebook in order to analyze the data for the project by dropping any column that is not relevant to this analysis and exporting them into csv files using Excel. After that, we used PgAdmin and SQL to create the tables that contain all the csv data as shown below.

1. Credit_Change Table

Credit scores often varies between 300 and 850. Since the file we based our analysis classified credit score in "poor, standard , and good" which we converted to "0, 1 and , 2 respectively, we determined that this file is more for efficient classification rather than a direct predictor of credit risk.  By using machine learning to classify applicant, a company should be able to devote more time assessing real credit risk based on the group of interest. For instance, the company can decide to drop all applicant assigned classification credit score equals 0. The company can also decide to extend credit to that same group but with a high interest rate or a security depoit. 

As a general rule, here are key factors that drive credit scores.

1.Payment history accounts for 35% of one person's credit score
2.Amount Owed - 30%
3. Credit History 15%
4. Credit Mix and New Credit- 10% each

In conclusion: Machine Learning could be used as an efficeint tool in the classification of credit applicants. Risk factors are however a mixed bag of identifiers as presented above to be able to make  definite credit decision.
