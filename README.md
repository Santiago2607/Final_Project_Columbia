## Reasons for Selecting the Topic

As interest rate keeps on getting higher, the topic of credit will become pertinent in that current credit card holder will pay more interest, future credit applicant will face more hurdles to get approved. In order to better assess applicants and classify them in category that will help in the decision making process, we want to apply machine learning to the credit classification process.

## Segment 1 

### Tools used in Segment 1
Some of the tools that we used during Segment 1 are Jupyter Notebook, SQL/PgAdmin and Excel.

### Description of Process in Segment 1
During the development of segment 1, we used Jupyter Notebook in order to analyze the data for the project by dropping any column that is not relevant to this analysis and exporting them into csv files using Excel. After that, we used PgAdmin and SQL to create the tables that contain all the csv data as shown below.
